Designing a database system for an e-commerce platformâ€™s order management system keeps track f customers, products, orders, and their details.
Design a normalized database schema to store and manage the order-related data, ensuring data integrity and avoiding redundancy.

Created a database in MySql using DDL statement, CREATE TABLE()
Use DML statement to enter table data using INSERT INTO() table_name and UPDATE() to update the value in existing table

Being the first beginner project, made use of almost all the basic and intermediate functions to query the dataset
Aggregate functions like SUM(), COUNT(), AVG(), MIN(), MAX()
Establishes realtionships between tables JOIN, INNER JOIN(),OUTER JOIN()
sorted the output using  ORDER BY(), GROUP BY()
using subquery helped in pulling out the values needed by terming the values
